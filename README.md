# Node-Restful-API
Node.js API authentication with JWT


just starting to learn about restful api, express js, mongodb

use post api environment

used nodemon, joi(for validation) dotenv and express packages.

dotenv encrypts our database username and password in ncase we wish to push it to github, but in rocu it will provide a dashboard like UI with environment variable.
